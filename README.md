# Zurich Billing Portal Frontend

A modern web application for managing billing records with Google OAuth authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Google Cloud Console account
- Backend server running on port 3337

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Search for "OAuth consent screen" and configure it:

   - Select "External" user type
   - Fill in the required application information

4. Search for "Credentials" and create OAuth client:
   - Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Web application" as application type
   - Enter a name for your OAuth client
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     ```
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     ```
   - Click "Create"
   - Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and replace the OAuth credentials:

```yaml
environment:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

## Setup and Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server First

Before running this frontend application, you need to set up and start the backend server:

1. Clone the backend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kenchoong/zurich-backend.git
   cd zurich-backend
   ```

2. Configure the admin email in the backend's `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   ADMIN_EMAIL: your-email@gmail.com # Change this to your Google email
   ```

   > **Important**: The email you set here must match the Google account you'll use to log in to the frontend. Only this email will receive admin privileges.

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Wait for the backend to fully initialize (database migrations and seeding will run automatically).

### 2. Start the Frontend Application

Once the backend is running, you can start this frontend application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3. Authentication and Admin Access

1. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with the Google account that matches the `ADMIN_EMAIL` configured in the backend
3. If the email matches, you'll receive a token with `role=admin` which grants full access to create, update, and delete operations
4. If you sign in with any other Google account, you'll receive a token with `role=not_admin` and will encounter 401 Unauthorized errors when attempting to modify data

> **Note**: Without admin privileges, you can still view data but cannot perform any write operations.

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth returns user credentials
3. Frontend extracts email from credentials
4. Frontend calls backend API `POST /sign-in` with the email
5. Backend checks if email matches `ADMIN_EMAIL`:
   - If match: Returns token with `role=admin`
   - If no match: Returns token with `role=not_admin`
6. Frontend stores token in localStorage
7. All subsequent API calls include this token in Authorization header

## Architecture

### Server Actions and API Structure

The application follows a clean architecture pattern that separates concerns between client components, server actions, and API endpoints:

#### Server Actions (`/src/app/actions`)

Server actions are Next.js 13+ features that allow server-side code execution directly from client components. In this application:

- Server actions are defined in the `actions` folder with the `"use server"` directive
- They act as an intermediary layer between frontend components and the actual API endpoints
- All server actions handle authentication token management and error handling
- Components interact exclusively with these server actions rather than making direct API calls

Example server action flow:

1. Component calls a server action (e.g., `createBillingRecord`)
2. Server action prepares the request with proper authentication headers
3. Server action makes the internal request to the Next.js API route
4. Server action processes the response and returns data to the component

#### API Routes (`/src/app/api`)

The API routes in the `api` folder handle the actual communication with the backend server:

- They receive requests from server actions
- They use the `ApiClient` service to communicate with the external backend
- They handle additional server-side logic like data transformation and validation
- They provide a consistent interface for all backend interactions

This two-layer approach provides several benefits:

- Enhanced security by keeping sensitive operations server-side
- Simplified client components that don't need to handle API complexities
- Consistent error handling and response formatting
- Clear separation of concerns in the codebase

## Features

- Google OAuth Authentication with role-based access
- Billing Records Management (CRUD operations)
- Secure API Integration with JWT
- Modern React UI with TypeScript
- Docker Containerization

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 13
- TypeScript
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Docker
- Google OAuth 2.0

## Development

The application uses:

- Port 3000 for frontend access
- Port 3337 for backend API

## Security Notes

- JWT tokens are stored in localStorage
- All API requests require valid JWT token
- Admin privileges are determined by email match
- CORS is configured for localhost development
